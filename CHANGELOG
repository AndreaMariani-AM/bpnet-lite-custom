Version 0.2.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Addition of a `ChromBPNet` model
	- Addition of an explicit, shared, `Logger` class
	- "Peak" semantics have been switched to "locus" semantics


chrombpnet.py
-------------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `ChromBPNet` class, which is a wrapper that
	takes in two BPNet objects: a pre-trained bias model, and an untrained
	accessibility model, and specifies the training procedure for training
	the accessibility model.


io.py
-----

	- The semantics of "peaks", e.g. `extract_peaks`, has been changed to loci,
	e.g. `extract_loci`, and the associated keywords (now `loci` from `peaks`)
	can take in a list or tuple of files to interleave them. This means you
	can now train on peaks and background regions.


logging.py
----------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `Logger` class which is a simple way to record
	and display statistics during training.
