> IMPORTANT: PBPNet is a personal implementation of the original [bpnet-lite](https://github.com/jmschrei/bpnet-lite) by Jacob Schreiber, which in turn is a lightweigth implementation in PyTorch of the original [BPNet](https://github.com/kundajelab/bpnet). Where i've adapted code from others it's properly cited at the top of the corresponding file. PBPNet stands for Polycomb BPNet.
