Release History
===============


Version 0.5.7
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Changed the `warning_threshold` argument to only print a warning rather
	than end the process when the model exceeds it.
	- Added support for plotting annotations alongside `plot_attributions` 
	- Fixed various minor bugs.


Version 0.5.6
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Changed the shape of the returned one-hot encoded sequences to match
	the documentation.
	- Fixed an issue with dinucleotide shuffling when not all nucleotides
	are present.



Version 0.5.5
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Fixed an issue with ChromBPNet reading.

Version 0.5.4
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Added in reading of TensorFlow-formatted ChromBPNet models from the
	official repo using the `from_chrombpnet` commands to the BPNet and
	ChromBPNet objects.


Version 0.5.2
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Fixed issue where non-linear operations in DeepLiftShap were not
	registered correctly and hence causing minor divergences. Through the
	use of an ugly wrapper object this has been fixed.
	- Added in `print_convergence_deltas` and `warning_threshold` to the
	`calculate_attributions` function and the `DeepLiftShap` object. The first
	will print convergence deltas for every example that gets explained and the
	second will raise a warning if the divergence is higher than it.


Version 0.5.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Extended support for the `chrombpnet` command-line tool
	- Now has mirrored functionality of the `bpnet` command-line tool
	- `chrombpnet pipeline` now mirrors `bpnet pipeline` except that it will
	run each of the reports on each of the three models: the full ChromBPNet
	model, the accessibility model, and the bias model. It will train a bias
	model and an accessibility model if not provided.
	- Changed the ChromBPNet object to be compatible with the `bpnet` command
	options.
	- Fixed issue with attributions where performance would degrade over time.


Version 0.4.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Extended support for the `bpnet` command-line tool
	- Added in `marginalize` command-line option for generating those reports
	- Added in `pipeline` command-line option for running a full pipeline from
    model training to inference, attribution, tfmodisco, and marginalization


Version 0.3.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- I forgot.


Version 0.2.0
==============

Highlights
----------

	- Addition of a `ChromBPNet` model
	- Addition of an explicit, shared, `Logger` class
	- "Peak" semantics have been switched to "locus" semantics


chrombpnet.py
-------------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `ChromBPNet` class, which is a wrapper that
	takes in two BPNet objects: a pre-trained bias model, and an untrained
	accessibility model, and specifies the training procedure for training
	the accessibility model.


io.py
-----

	- The semantics of "peaks", e.g. `extract_peaks`, has been changed to loci,
	e.g. `extract_loci`, and the associated keywords (now `loci` from `peaks`)
	can take in a list or tuple of files to interleave them. This means you
	can now train on peaks and background regions.


logging.py
----------

	- Newly added.
	- This file contains the `Logger` class which is a simple way to record
	and display statistics during training.
